=== RESEARCH STEP 1 ===
Summary: This report identifies key influencers in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning domains, focusing on individuals with over 50,000 followers. The research leveraged `novada_google_search` and `tavily_search_results_json` to identify prominent figures, their social media presence, and available contact information. Due to limitations in direct social media API access for platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, follower counts and engagement metrics are primarily derived from search result snippets and may require further direct verification. Contact methods are provided where publicly available; otherwise, they are flagged as 'Gap - needs follow-up'.
