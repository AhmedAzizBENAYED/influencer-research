=== RESEARCH STEP 1 ===
It appears the `novada_google_search` tool encountered an API key error, which prevented it from executing the initial broad search. However, the `tavily_search_results_json` tool successfully provided a good starting point with several potential AI and machine learning influencers across various platforms.

I have identified the following individuals as potential candidates based on the initial search:

*   **Trey Smith**: Mentioned as an AI influencer on Instagram.
*   **Ronald Van Loon**: Identified as a top influencer in AI, big data, data science, IoT, machine learning, analytics, cloud, and 5G, with a strong presence on Twitter.
*   **Allie K. Miller**: Implied as an AI influencer.
*   **Tamara McCleary**: Global speaker and CEO, covering digital transformation, AI, blockchain, IoT, 5G, and diversity, with a strong Twitter presence.
*   **Nige Willson**: Speaker, influencer, and advisor on AI, machine learning, and AI ethics, founder of awakenai.org.
*   **Dhaval Patel (Codebasics)**: Mentioned for Python, Machine Learning, SQL, and Power BI tutorials, likely on YouTube.
*   **Steve Nouri**: Identified for work on AI trends, ethical considerations, and diversity in technology on LinkedIn.
*   **Mohammad Arshad**: Co-organizer of Decoding Data Science community in Dubai, likely on LinkedIn.
*   **Kunal Jain**: Data Scientist, Hacker, Entrepreneur, machine learning enthusiast, active on Twitter.
*   **Daphne Koller**: Founder and CEO of @insitro, Machine Learning pioneer, co-founder of Coursera, active on Twitter.
*   **Erik Brynjolfsson**: Director @DigEconLab, Professor @StanfordHAI, active on Twitter.
*   **Timnit Gebru**: Active on Twitter.
*   **Pascal Bornet**: AI influencer on LinkedIn.
*   **Andrew Ng**: AI influencer on LinkedIn with a significant follower count.
*   **Kai-Fu Lee**: AI influencer on LinkedIn with a significant follower count.

My next steps will be to systematically gather more detailed information for each of these influencers, focusing on their primary platforms, follower counts, engagement metrics, audience demographics, contact methods, recent brand partnerships, estimated sponsored-post rates, notable strengths, content style, and potential red flags. I will prioritize using platform-specific lookup tools where possible and supplement with general search for contact details and other insights.

I will start by attempting to gather more information on Ronald Van Loon and Trey Smith, as they were highlighted with specific platform mentions. I will then proceed through the rest of the list.

Given the API key error for `novada_google_search`, I will rely heavily on `tavily_search_results_json` for general web searches and the specific social media lookup tools.

I will begin by trying to find more specific social media handles and then use the appropriate lookup tools.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Search for Ronald Van Loon's and Trey Smith's social media profiles to get their exact handles.
2.  Use `twitter_lookup` for Ronald Van Loon and `instagram_lookup` (if an Instagram handle is found) for Trey Smith.
3.  Continue this process for the other identified influencers, prioritizing those with clear platform indications.
4.  For contact information, I will use `tavily_search_results_json` with queries like "[influencer name] contact email" or "[influencer name] business inquiries."
5.  If a website is found, I will check for contact pages or use `hunter_email_finder` if a domain is available (though `hunter_email_finder` is not in the provided tools, I will note this as a potential future step if I had access).

I will now proceed with the next set of tool calls.
