=== RESEARCH STEP 1 ===
Summary: This report identifies potential AI and Machine Learning influencers with 50K+ followers, leveraging broad search queries to discover prominent figures across various platforms. Due to the limitations of the available tools (lack of direct Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube lookup functions, and a dedicated email finder), detailed follower counts, engagement metrics, and verified direct contact emails are challenging to obtain directly. Many entries will reflect "Gap - needs follow-up" for these specific metrics. The focus is on identifying individuals frequently cited as influential in AI/ML and then attempting to find their social media presence and any publicly available contact information.

**Next Steps/Recommendations:**

*   **Direct Social Media Lookups:** To get accurate follower counts and engagement metrics, direct API calls to Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube would be crucial. The current tools do not support this, leading to "Gap - needs follow-up" for these metrics.
*   **Email Verification:** A dedicated email finder tool (like Hunter.io or similar) would be highly beneficial for verifying business emails. Manual search often yields only general contact forms or agency contacts.
*   **Sponsored Post Rates:** This information is rarely public. Direct outreach or specialized influencer marketing platforms are usually required to obtain estimated rates.
*   **Audience Demographics:** While niche alignment can be inferred, detailed audience demographics (age, gender, location) typically require access to influencer analytics platforms.

This report provides a strong foundation of prominent AI/ML influencers based on public recognition and their professional roles. However, the "Gap - needs follow-up" flags highlight areas where more specialized tools or direct outreach would be necessary to fulfill all aspects of the original query.
