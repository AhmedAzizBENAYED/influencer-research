=== RESEARCH STEP 1 ===
Here's a comprehensive research report on AI and Machine Learning influencers, based on your query and the available tools.

**Summary:**

The research identified several prominent influencers in the AI and Machine Learning space, primarily active on Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn. These individuals demonstrate significant reach and engagement, sharing insights, tutorials, and discussions on various aspects of AI, data science, and related technologies. While follower counts are generally high, specific engagement metrics like average likes and comments per post, and estimated sponsored-post rates, remain challenging to pinpoint without direct access to analytics platforms or influencer marketing databases. Contact information, where available, primarily consists of business emails or management contacts.

**Next Steps/Recommendations:**

*   **Deeper Engagement Analysis:** For influencers with "Gap - needs follow-up" for engagement, consider using specialized influencer analytics tools (if available) to get more granular data on average likes, comments, and view rates per post.
*   **Direct Outreach for Rates:** For estimated sponsored-post rates, direct outreach to the influencers or their management would be the most reliable method. This is typically done in a later stage of influencer marketing.
*   **Audience Demographics:** While some general niche alignment is identified, detailed audience demographics (age, gender, location, interests) often require access to the influencer's platform analytics or third-party tools.
*   **Brand Partnerships:** Further targeted searches for "\[Influencer Name] brand partnerships" or "\[Influencer Name] sponsored content" might reveal more information, but this can be challenging to find publicly.
*   **Red Flag Follow-up:** For Trey Smith, the extremely low engagement rate warrants a deeper dive to understand if it's due to an inactive audience, content style, or other factors.
