**Next Steps/Gaps:**

*   **Engagement Metrics:** This is a significant gap for most influencers. Direct API lookups for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube would be ideal to get recent engagement rates (likes, comments, view-rate).
*   **Verified Contact Details:** While some general contact avenues (websites, LinkedIn) are noted, specific business or management emails are largely missing. `hunter_email_finder` could be used if a clear domain is associated with an influencer's personal brand or company.
*   **Audience Demographics:** This information is generally not publicly available through simple searches and would require access to influencer analytics tools or direct communication with the influencer/their management.
*   **Estimated Sponsored-Post Rates:** This is highly proprietary information and rarely publicly disclosed. It would typically be obtained through direct negotiation or specialized influencer marketing platforms.
*   **Missing Follower Counts:** For some influencers, particularly those primarily active on LinkedIn, precise follower counts were not immediately available in the initial search results. Targeted `linkedin_lookup` (if an email domain is found) or more specific search queries might yield this.

To fill these gaps, further targeted API calls using `instagram_lookup`, `tiktok_lookup`, `youtube_lookup`, and `twitter_lookup` would be necessary if direct handles were consistently provided and the tools were functional for engagement metrics. Given the current tool limitations for direct engagement metrics and the `novada_google_search` API key error, obtaining these details will be challenging without further tool access or manual research.
