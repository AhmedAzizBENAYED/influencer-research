Summary: This report identifies top cybersecurity experts and influencers with a strong social media presence and at least 50,000 followers, as per the research query. The focus is on providing actionable insights, including contact details, audience demographics, and potential red flags. Due to tool limitations, direct social media lookups for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are not available, requiring reliance on general web searches for follower counts and engagement metrics.

**Next Steps/Limitations:**

*   **Direct Social Media Lookups:** The current toolset lacks direct API access for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube to pull precise follower counts, engagement rates, and audience demographics. This information was primarily gathered through general web searches and is an estimation based on publicly available data.
*   **Verified Contact Information:** Obtaining direct business emails or management contacts for many top-tier influencers is challenging without dedicated influencer marketing platforms or direct outreach. Many prefer contact forms or DMs.
*   **Sponsored Post Rates:** This information is highly proprietary and rarely publicly disclosed. Estimating rates would require access to industry benchmarks or direct negotiation data, which is beyond the scope of current tools.
*   **Audience Demographics:** While niche alignment is clear, precise demographic data (age, gender, location breakdown) is not available through general web searches or the provided tools. This would typically require access to influencer analytics platforms.

To further enhance this research, consider:
*   Utilizing specialized influencer marketing platforms that offer detailed analytics and contact information.
*   Directly reaching out to influencers or their management via publicly available contact forms or DMs for specific inquiries.
*   Cross-referencing information with industry reports on influencer rates.
