**Recommendations:**

*   **Prioritize based on platform and engagement:** Allie K. Miller, Sundas Khalid, and Domenic Ashburn have strong Instagram presences, aligning with the target platform. Andrew Ng and Ronald van Loon are highly influential on Twitter and LinkedIn, which could be valuable for thought leadership campaigns.
*   **Follow-up on engagement metrics:** For influencers where engagement metrics are "Gap - needs follow-up," consider using specialized influencer marketing platforms or manual analysis of recent posts to get a better understanding of their audience interaction.
*   **Verify contact information:** For Trey Smith and Ronald van Loon, further investigation is needed to find verified business emails. For Fabio Moioli, the provided email might be outdated, so alternative contact methods should be explored.
*   **Research sponsored-post rates:** This information is often not publicly available and usually requires direct outreach or access to influencer marketing platforms. This remains a significant "Gap - needs follow-up" for all influencers.
*   **Consider micro-influencers:** While the query specified 50K+ followers, some of the initially identified influencers (John Anthony, Chris Harris, Julia Lukas, Alex Freberg) have smaller but potentially highly engaged niche audiences. If the campaign allows, these could be valuable for more targeted outreach.

**Next Steps (if further research is required and tools allow):**

*   Utilize specialized influencer marketing platforms for more precise follower counts, engagement rates, and audience demographics.
*   Employ advanced email finding tools (if available and within scope) for influencers where direct contact details are missing.
*   Conduct deeper dives into content analysis to understand specific content styles and potential brand fit.
