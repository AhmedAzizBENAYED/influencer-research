**15. Sundar Krishnamurthy**
*   **Full Name and Primary Handle(s):** Sundar Krishnamurthy, @sundar.krishnamurthy (Instagram)
*   **Main Platform(s):** LinkedIn, Instagram, X (Twitter)
*   **Follower Count:** LinkedIn: 4K (Source: tavily_search_results_json_response, ID: 5715041), Instagram: 2.9K+ (Source: tavily_search_results_json_response, ID: 53997856), X: 21 followers (Source: tavily_search_results_json_response, ID: 6914979)
*   **Recent Engagement Metrics:** Gap - needs follow-up

**Summary of Gaps and Next Steps:**

*   **Engagement Metrics:** Specific engagement rates (likes, comments, view-rates) are largely unavailable through public search. This would require direct access to social media analytics tools or influencer platforms. **Gap - needs follow-up.**
*   **Contact Methods:** While some email addresses and contact forms were found, direct business emails for all influencers were not consistently available. **Gap - needs follow-up.**
*   **Recent Brand Partnerships and Estimated Sponsored-Post Rates:** This information is highly proprietary and rarely public. **Gap - needs follow-up.**
*   **Follower Verification:** For Mike Miller, the 393K Twitter followers need to be explicitly verified to confirm it's the cybersecurity expert. For Rachel Tobac and Jessy Irwin, more precise Twitter follower counts would be beneficial.
*   **LinkedIn Follower Counts:** For several influencers, the exact LinkedIn follower count was not explicitly stated in the search results, only "500+ connections" or "K followers."

To further enhance this research, a dedicated social media analytics tool would be invaluable for precise engagement metrics and audience demographics. Direct outreach to management/agencies or the influencers themselves would be necessary to obtain business contact details and sponsored-post rates.
