=== RESEARCH STEP 1 ===
I am currently unable to perform the requested influencer research. The search tools (`novada_google_search` and `tavily_search_results_json`) are consistently returning errors, preventing me from gathering any data on AI and machine learning influencers.

I cannot proceed with the research until these tools are operational. Please address the issues with the search APIs, and I will be able to resume the task.

=== VERIFICATION STEP 2 ===
I understand you are currently unable to perform the requested influencer research due to persistent errors with the `novada_google_search` and `tavily_search_results_json` tools.

As the **verification-and-quality-control assistant**, my role is to audit a *draft influencer dossier* created by previous agents. Since no draft dossier has been generated due to the tool failures, I cannot proceed with my audit responsibilities (source audit, accuracy check, gap spotting).

Please address the issues with the search APIs. Once the initial research is successfully completed and a draft dossier is provided, I will be able to perform my verification and quality control tasks.

=== RESEARCH STEP 3 ===
I'm encountering issues with the search APIs, specifically `novada_google_search` and `tavily_search_results_json`, which are returning errors. This is preventing me from gathering the necessary data to identify AI and machine learning influencers and their contact details.

I will attempt to re-run the search queries, focusing on prominent AI/ML figures and then broadening to general "AI and machine learning influencers" to identify potential candidates. I will prioritize finding their social media handles, follower counts, engagement metrics, and most importantly, their contact information.

If the API issues persist, I will need to flag this as a critical blocker.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Retry searching for "Andrew Ng contact email business inquiries" using both `novada_google_search` and `tavily_search_results_json`.
2.  Initiate broader searches for "top AI influencers," "machine learning influencers," and "AI thought leaders" to identify a list of potential candidates.
3.  For each identified influencer, attempt to find their social media profiles (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn), follower counts, and any publicly available contact information (business email, agency contact, website).
4.  If contact information is not readily available, I will attempt to use `hunter_email_finder` if a domain is associated with them, or search for "influencer_name email" or "influencer_name contact" to find direct contact methods.

I will continue to use all available tools to gather the required information for the influencer profiles.

=== VERIFICATION STEP 4 ===
I understand you are still encountering issues with the search APIs (`novada_google_search` and `tavily_search_results_json`), which are preventing the generation of the initial draft influencer dossier.

As the **verification-and-quality-control assistant**, my function is to audit an *existing* dossier. Since no draft dossier has been successfully created due to the persistent tool failures, I am unable to perform my audit responsibilities (source audit, accuracy check, gap spotting).

I am awaiting the successful completion of the initial research phase and the provision of a draft dossier. Once that is available, I will be able to proceed with my verification and quality control tasks.

=== RESEARCH STEP 5 ===
I am currently unable to perform the requested research due to API errors with the `novada_google_search` and `tavily_search_results_json` tools. It appears there might be an issue with frequent requests or API key permissions.

Please try again later, and I will attempt to conduct the comprehensive influencer research as requested.

=== VERIFICATION STEP 6 ===

*   Identify a comprehensive list of AI and machine learning influencers.
*   Gather detailed information such as follower counts, engagement metrics, contact methods, or past brand partnerships.
*   Provide 15-20 high-quality influencer profiles as requested.

**Next Steps:**
Please ensure that the API keys for `novada_google_search` and `tavily_search_results_json` are correctly configured and that I have the necessary permissions to use them. Once these issues are resolved, I can proceed with the research.
