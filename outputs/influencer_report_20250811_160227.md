**Next Steps/Recommendations:**

*   **Direct Email Acquisition:** For influencers where contact information is listed as "Gap - needs follow-up," further targeted searches using `novada_google_search` or `tavily_search_results_json` with queries like "[Influencer Name] business email" or "[Influencer Name] contact" should be performed. Checking their personal websites for a "Contact Us" page or a dedicated business inquiry email is crucial.
*   **LinkedIn for Professional Contacts:** For influencers with a strong LinkedIn presence, using `linkedin_lookup` (if a company domain is associated with them) or further general searches on LinkedIn could yield professional contact details.
*   **Engagement Metrics Deep Dive:** While general engagement levels are noted, a more precise understanding of recent engagement metrics (e.g., average likes/comments per post on Twitter, average view-to-subscriber ratio on YouTube) would require direct access to platform analytics, which is beyond the scope of current tools. For critical campaigns, manual review of recent posts would be necessary.
*   **Sponsored Post Rates:** Estimated sponsored post rates are rarely public. This information is typically obtained through direct inquiry or via influencer marketing platforms.
*   **Expand Search for Instagram/TikTok:** If a strong presence on Instagram or TikTok is desired, more specific searches like "[Influencer Name] Instagram" or "[Influencer Name] TikTok" would be needed to identify their handles and then manually check follower counts and engagement.

This report provides a solid foundation for identifying and engaging with key cybersecurity influencers. Further targeted efforts will be required to fill in the remaining data gaps, particularly verified contact information and detailed engagement metrics.
